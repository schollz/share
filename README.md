Share moves files between machines with a clean web UI and a focused CLI.

## Install

Grab `share_linux.zip`, `share_macos.zip`, or `share_windows.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/schollz/share/releases/latest), unpack it, move the resulting binary into your `PATH`, and make it executable (`share.exe` on Windows ships ready to run). On Linux you can also install with 

```bash
curl https://share.schollz.com | bash
```

## Usage

Run `share serve` to host the local web interface on `http://localhost:3001` for drag-and-drop transfers, or use the CLI directly:

- Send a file or folder with `share send <file> <room>` to push through the relay at `share.schollz.com` (override with `--domain` or `--server`).
- Receive from another peer with `share receive <room>` and optionally `--output` to choose the destination folder.

You can also join rooms from the hosted web app at https://share.schollz.com when a browser-only workflow is easier.
